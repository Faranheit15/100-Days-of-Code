<h4>1. Bookmark the Course Resources Page</h4><p>Throughout the course, I'll be pointing you towards links and resources. To save you time, I've compiled all the links and resources on one page. It's a good idea to head over there now and bookmark the page.</p><p>Whenever you come across something in the course that I talk about, you should be able to find a link to it on the course resources page.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/appbrewery/100-days-of-python" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://github.com/appbrewery/100-days-of-python</a></p><p><br></p><h4>2.

Download the "12 Rules to Learn to Code" eBook</h4><p>I wrote this book for students who are learning to code for the first time. It's a good resource and I've collected together some of the best advice from myself and other senior developers.</p><p>You can download the PDF book in the resources for this lesson.</p><p><br></p>
